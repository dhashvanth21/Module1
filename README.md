# Conditional Statements in Python: Even or Odd Checker

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to check whether the given number is **even** or **odd** using `if...else` statements.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Get an input from the user.
2. Convert the input to an integer and store it in a variable `a`.
3. Use the modulo operator `%` to check if `a % 2 == 0`.
   - If true, print `"EVEN"`.
   - Else, print `"ODD"`.
4. End the program.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
a=int(input())

if(a%2==0):
     print("EVEN")
else:
     print("ODD")
```

## Result
Thus, the python program was executed successfully




# Ex 1:Datatypes-Boolean Expression Evaluation in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that evaluates and prints the results of boolean and arithmetic expressions involving `True` and `False`.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Start the program.
2. Assign `a` as the result of `False == True`.
3. Assign `b` as the result of `False == 0`.
4. Assign `c` as the result of `False + True`.
5. Assign `d` as the result of `False + 5`.
6. Print whether `a` is `True or False`.
7. Print whether `b` is `True or False`.
8. Print the value of `c`.
9. Print the value of `d`.
10. End the program.

## ðŸ’» Program
Add Code here
```
a = (False == True)

b = (False== 0)

c = False + True

d = False + 5


print("a is",a)
print("b is",b)
print("c:",c)
print("d:",d)
```

# Datatypes-Character Literal in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that prints the characters `'T'` and `'a'` using character literals.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Print the character `'T'`.
2. Print the character `'a'`.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
v = 'T'
w = "a"
print(v)
print(w)
```

## Output

## Result
Thus, the python program was executed successfully

# ðŸ§® Datatypes-Complex Number Creation in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that reads two integers, creates a complex number using them, and then prints the complex number along with its real and imaginary parts.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Read an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `a` (real part).
2. Read another integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `b` (imaginary part).
3. Create a complex number `x` using the `complex(a, b)` function.
4. Print the complex number `x`.
5. Print the real part of `x` using `x.real`.
6. Print the imaginary part of `x` using `x.imag`.

## ðŸ’» Program
Add Code Here
```
real_part = float(input())
imaginary_part = float(input())
complex_number = complex(real_part, imaginary_part)
print(complex_number)
print(complex_number.real)
```

## Output

## Result
Thus, the python program was executed successfully


# Datatypes-Read and Print a String in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to read a string from the user and then print it.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Assign a variable named `men_stepped_on_the_moon`.
2. Use `input()` to read a string from the user and store it in the variable.
3. Print the value stored in the variable.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
men_stepped_on_the_moon=int(input())
print(men_stepped_on_the_moon)
```

## Output
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7309e4dc-0552-4116-b7d4-2961209d4318)

## Result
Thus, the python program was executed successfully
